This is a google chrome extension that enable users to use Japanese emoticons by just clicking their image on the popup display.

Includes:
  - finding an emoticon you want by **searching a keyword**
  - showing your **most recently used emoticons**, to avoid scrolling to find commonly used emoticons
  - having a **favourite section** to avoid scrolling to find commonly used emoticons


Got all the images from pixabey.com, I do not own any of the images used.
